# Machine_Learning-Final_Project
This is my machine learning final project which i developed to finish my course on coursera.
After finishing this course, i recieved a Machine Learning Certification authorized by IBM and issued by Coursera.
In this course i have learned Machine Learning techniques such as Regression (Linear, Non-linear, Simple and Multiple regression), Classification (KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and SVM), Clustering approaches (Partitioned-based Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Density-based Clustering), Recommendation engines (content-based and collaborative filtering).
Also i have learned how to evaluate my model and calculate its accuracy using different evaluation metrics such as: Jaccard, F1-score and LogLoss.
Finally i finished my course with a project where i developed a classification model used to predict a label value and evaluate it self.
This two links are for my certifications verification:
