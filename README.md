# Machine_Learning-Final_Project-
Final project to finish my machine learning course on coursera by IBM.
I recieved a Machine Learning Certification authorized by IBM and issued by Coursera after finishing this course.
In this course i have learned Machine Learning techniques such as Regression (Linear, Non-linear, Simple and Multiple regression), Classification (KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and SVM), Clustering approaches (Partitioned-based Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Density-based Clustering), Recommendation engines (content-based and collaborative filtering).
Also i have learned how to evaluate my model and calculate its accuracy using the test set using different evaluation metrics such as: Jaccard, F1-score and LogLoss.
Finally i finished my course with a final project where i designed a classification model used to predict label values and evaluate it self.
